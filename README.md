placeholder-shiv
================

Tiny polyfill for the placeholder form element attribute. Requires [Prototype.js](http://prototypejs.org) or [jQuery](http://jquery.com).

This Prototype JavaScript simulates the `placeholder` attribute in browsers that do not support it yet. It doesnâ€™t do anying if placeholders are supported, and degrades to show nothing if both placeholder and JavaScript support are missing.
  
To apply it, simply code your form elements with placeholders, and add a link to prototype.js and placeholder-shiv.js or jquery.js and placeholder-shiv.jquery.js in the head of your page.
  
The only caution is that the placeholder text cannot be exactly the same as a potential actual input value. Pad the placeholder value with trailing spaces to avoid this issue.
